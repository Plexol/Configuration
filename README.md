## Game Setups
**Gaming** repository contains all my Video Game configuration files. If you want to use or test my personal configurations feel free to. However before using the configs I created you must agree to the [License](https://github.com/Plexol/Gaming/blob/master/LICENSE) agreement.

Branches connected to the [Master](https://github.com/Plexol/Gaming/tree/master) branch contain my personal configurations for games I play. Just go to the branch tab and select the game title you wish to browse.
