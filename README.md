## Game Setups
The **Gaming** repository contains all my Video Game configuration files. If you want to use or test my personal settings feel free to. However, before using the configs I created you must agree to the [License](https://github.com/Plexol/Gaming/blob/master/LICENSE) agreement. All Configuration files contains all settings from `Video` `Gameplay` `Controls` `Audio` and `Multiplayer` for the specific game branch selected.
