The **_Configuration_** repository contains all my Video Game configuration files. If you want to use or test my personal settings feel free to. However, before using the configs I created you must read & agree to the [License](https://github.com/Plexol/Gaming/blob/master/LICENSE) agreement. All Configuration files contain all settings from Video, Gameplay, Controls, Audio, and Multiplayer for the specific game selected.

Click on the **Downloads** menu below and select the game title you wish to view configurations for. Then, click the download option you want. All game folders come with files called **_READ ME_**, **_LICENSE_**, and **_INSTALL_**, just read all of them to setup the package correctly.
